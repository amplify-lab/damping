# Damping — engineering notes for AI agents and contributors

This file is for anyone (human or AI agent) working *on* this codebase. If you're looking for how to *use* Damping, see [`README.md`](README.md) instead.

## README.md is public-facing only — what never goes there

`README.md` is written for the general public: anyone deciding whether to install and use Damping. Keep it to usage, the quick-start tutorial, the demo screenshot, and the feature comparison table — nothing else. Specifically, **never add to `README.md`** (or any other file destined for this public repo):

- Internal development plans, roadmap reasoning, phase-sequencing rationale, or anything that reads like a decision log for the team rather than documentation for a user. That belongs in `CLAUDE.md` (engineering conventions) or a dedicated research doc under `docs/`, not the README.
- Business-sensitive content of any kind: pricing/negotiation strategy, named prospect/customer lists, financial projections, competitor commentary that isn't measured and fact-checked (a fair, sourced comparison table is fine — an uncited jab is not), or anything that reads as internal strategy rather than public product information.
- Credentials, tokens, API keys, or any other secret — obviously, but this repo's own history has a real incident to learn from (see below).

This project already learned this lesson the expensive way once: on first publishing this repo, a pre-push audit caught a real leaked access token and 5 internal business-planning documents (market research, business plan, brand naming, competitive positioning/messaging strategy) that had been sitting in `docs/` since early commits. All were removed via `git-filter-repo` from full git history (not just deleted in a new commit — that would leave them recoverable in old commits), and one round of that removal happened *after* the repo had already gone public, requiring a force-push to overwrite exposed history. Full backups of the removed content exist outside this repo for Tim's own reference, not in git. See the commit history around 2026-07-06 (`chore: remove internal-only planning docs before first public push` and the docs/00 follow-up) for the specifics, and treat any future "should this go in the public repo" question the same way: if you're unsure whether something is public-safe, it isn't — ask first, don't publish and fix later.

## Repo status

`github.com/amplify-lab/damping` is **public**, live, and this is the *only* public-facing artifact for this project — there is no separate private mirror repo. Everything under version control here (code, docs, commit history) is visible to anyone.

Tim maintains a **separate materials folder entirely outside this git repository** (not gitignored-inside — fully outside, so git has no path to it at all, which is a harder guarantee than gitignore against an accidental `git add -f` or a gitignore misconfiguration). This is not just an archive of removed files — it is the **active, ongoing home for this project's planning and discussion**, the same role `docs/00-統一開發計畫（定案版）.md` used to serve before it was removed from this repo. It currently holds: the five internal planning documents and the old master plan doc removed per the section above, the enterprise-infrastructure research (three rounds — self-hosted-vs-vendor tradeoffs for the OAuth/Cloudflare/control-plane/memory-poisoning decisions, moved out of `docs/` for the same reason as the other business/competitive-reasoning content above), and going forward, any new planning, roadmap discussion, or internal research should be drafted there by default — only promote something into this actual repo once it's deliberately decided to be public product documentation. If you're an AI agent working in this repo and need that context, ask Tim directly for it — do not attempt to reconstruct any of it here from memory or old conversation context, and do not assume it's absent or that planning has stalled just because you don't see a roadmap doc in this repo.

The billing/licensing/enterprise-control-plane code for Phase 5 does not exist yet and, per the agreed open-core model, will live in a **separate, private repository** when it's built — never in this one. This repo (`core/` + `cli/`) is and stays the permissively-licensed, publicly-inspectable half of the product on purpose; that inspectability is a stated part of Damping's trust story, not an oversight to fix later.

## Read first

- [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) — module layout, the `ActionEvent`/`Decision` schema, why `core/` and `cli/` are split.
- [`docs/threat-model.md`](docs/threat-model.md) — what Damping defends against, known bypass classes, fail-open vs. fail-closed.
- [`docs/cli-reference.md`](docs/cli-reference.md) — full command surface, hook contract, policy file schema.

## Repository map

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/architecture.md` | Monorepo layout, module naming, `ActionEvent`/`Decision` schema |
| `docs/cli-reference.md` | Full `damping` command surface, hook contract, policy file schema |
| `docs/threat-model.md` | What Damping defends against, known bypass classes, fail-open vs. fail-closed |
| `docs/ux-dashboard-spec.md` | Phase 4/5 team dashboard & enterprise compliance UI spec |
| `features/` | Gherkin BDD scenarios — the acceptance criteria for every phase |
| `core/` | Transport-agnostic policy engine, schema, audit log — no dependency on any specific agent/transport |
| `cli/` | The `damping` binary: hook entrypoint, `mcp wrap`, `log`/`status`/`doctor`/`dashboard` subcommands |

## Building and testing

Requires Go 1.26+.

```
cd core && go build ./... && go test ./... -race -count=1
cd ../cli && go build ./... && go test ./... -race -count=1
```

Both modules build and test independently — `cli/go.mod` pins `core` via a `replace ../core` directive until `core` has a tagged release (a root `go.work` also exists for editor/IDE convenience). Before any commit, all of these should be clean, from both `core/` and `cli/`:

```
go build ./...
go vet ./...
gofmt -l .            # should print nothing
golangci-lint run ./...
gosec ./...
```

Run just the BDD suite on its own:

```
cd cli && go test ./bdd/... -v
```

A short local fuzz run on the shell parser (the one function that runs on fully untrusted input by design) is worth doing after touching `cli/shell`:

```
cd cli && go test ./shell/... -run=^$ -fuzz=FuzzAnalyze -fuzztime=30s
```

## Development methodology: BDD, scenario-first

This project's own governing rule is **情境通過才算完成** — "a scenario only counts as done once it passes." A feature isn't considered built until its Gherkin acceptance criteria are wired to real code and green — not the other way around (code first, tests added after, if at all).

The two halves:
- **`features/*.feature`** — Gherkin, one scenario per acceptance criterion, written in plain English before any implementation exists. Meant to be readable by someone who has never opened the Go source.
- **`cli/bdd/*_test.go`** — the real step-definition wiring, via [`cucumber/godog`](https://github.com/cucumber/godog), one file per feature file. Each file's `godog.TestSuite` runs from an ordinary `func TestFeatures_X(t *testing.T)`, so a plain `go test ./...` from `cli/` already executes every scenario as part of the normal test run — no separate suite to remember, no extra CI step.

Not every step is (or should be) a from-scratch runtime check. A step gets a **documented pass-through** instead of a second, weaker re-implementation when the behavior is already proven end-to-end by an equivalent, more thorough test elsewhere (e.g. MCP always-allow/deny session persistence is exercised by `cli/adapter/mcp/wrap_test.go`, not reinvented as Gherkin steps), or when the scenario describes a structural invariant that isn't independently observable from a single dynamic test run (e.g. "no adapter writes to the audit file directly"). Every such pass-through must carry an inline comment naming which real test covers it and why — an undocumented no-op step is a bug in the suite, not an accepted shortcut, since it silently stops proving the thing its own Gherkin wording claims to prove.

`@phase4`/`@phase5`-tagged scenarios (`team_dashboard.feature`, `compliance_report.feature`) describe features that don't exist yet — intentionally unwired, not broken.

### Adding or changing a policy rule

Every rule needs **both**:
1. A scenario in `features/dangerous_command.feature` (or `mcp_tool_governance.feature`) asserting it **blocks** a real dangerous case.
2. A scenario asserting it does **not** block a normal, safe case.

Add the matcher function in `core/policy/rules*.go`, register it in the `matchers` map, add the rule's metadata (including `risk:`, one of `low`/`medium`/`high`/`critical` — `Config.Validate()` rejects anything else) to `cli/policies/default.yaml`, and mirror both directions as Go tests. If the OPA/Rego engine is in scope for the change, keep `core/policy/policy.rego` in sync — `opa_equivalence_test.go` fails if the two engines ever diverge for the same input.

### Verifying a fix is real: mutation testing

For every behavioral bug fix, before considering it done: temporarily revert the fix, confirm the new or updated test now fails for the right reason, restore the fix, confirm green again. A test that can't fail this way isn't actually testing the fix.

## Implementation status (detail)

High-level status lives in README.md; this is the deeper per-package picture.

- **`core/`** — the transport-agnostic `ActionEvent` schema, the V1 policy engine (11 default rules, split across `rules_shell.go`/`rules_mcp.go`/`rules_selfprotection.go` by concern), always-allow/deny pattern matching (`patterns.go`) and persistence (`persist.go` — edits the policy YAML via `yaml.Node` surgery so comments and formatting elsewhere in the file survive), and the append-only JSONL audit log (`core/audit`, with rotation and crash-safe atomic writes via `core/atomicfile`).
- **`cli/`** — the `damping` binary: `init`, `doctor`, `status`, `on`/`off`, `log` (with `--channel`/`--risk`/`--actor`/`--outcome`/`--since`/`--limit` filters, a `tail -f`-style `--follow`, plus `log show <event_id>`), `policy list`/`test`/`validate`, `version`, and the real Claude Code `PreToolUse` hook entrypoint (`damping hook pretooluse`), including the `/dev/tty`-based confirmation flow with full allow-once/always-allow/deny-once/always-deny support (see `docs/architecture.md` §6 for why stdin/stdout can't be reused for that).
- **`damping mcp wrap -- <server-command>`** — the V1 thin MCP adapter (`cli/adapter/mcp`), a real client+server pair built on the official Go SDK: discovers the wrapped server's tools, re-exposes them unchanged, and runs every tool call through the exact same `core/policy` engine and `core/audit` log the CLI hook uses, before forwarding an allowed call to the real subprocess. No OAuth, no confused-deputy defense yet — that's Phase 3.
- **Shell danger detection** (`cli/shell`) — real `mvdan.cc/sh/v3` AST parsing (`parser.go`), Facts extraction (`facts.go`), and an explicit semantic layer for what AST parsing alone doesn't catch (`literal.go` + rule matchers): known aliases, base64/base32/uudecode/`xxd -r`/`openssl`-pipe-to-shell structural patterns, `/proc` sandbox-bypass path literals, dynamically-constructed command names, writes redirected into protected paths, and recursion into every command/process substitution (argument, redirect target, here-string) plus any heredoc body addressed to a real shell interpreter. `rm -rf` checks every path operand independently, not just the last word. See `docs/threat-model.md` §3.
- **BDD scenarios that actually run** — every V1-scope `features/*.feature` file executes for real via `godog` (`cli/bdd`): `dangerous_command.feature` (47 scenarios), `self_protection.feature`, `mcp_tool_governance.feature`, `audit_log.feature`, `policy_config.feature`, `local_dashboard.feature`.
- **OPA/Rego policy engine (Phase 3, partial)** — every rule above also has an embedded OPA/Rego implementation (`core/policy/policy.rego` + `opa.go`), selectable per-deployment via `policy.yaml`'s `engine: opa` field. `core/policy/opa_equivalence_test.go` proves both engines return byte-identical decisions for every rule; `opa_bench_test.go` gates eval latency at sub-millisecond.
- **`damping dashboard`** — a local, single-user web view of the audit log (`cli/dashboard`): summary strip, filterable event table, per-session risk sparklines, live tail via Server-Sent Events, no separate frontend build (vanilla JS + a Tailwind-compiled stylesheet checked into the repo, embedded via `go:embed`). Not Phase 4's team dashboard (`docs/ux-dashboard-spec.md`) — that's a separate, not-yet-built React+TS app.
- **Release engineering** (`.goreleaser.yaml`, `install.sh`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`) — cross-platform builds, a Homebrew cask, a one-line install script, all verified end-to-end locally.
- **Not yet built**: Phase 3's full Gateway (OAuth 2.1, confused-deputy defense), Phase 4's Cloudflare-based team dashboard, Phase 5's enterprise/compliance tier, Phase 6's memory-poisoning defense. Infra research on these (self-hosted vs. vendor tradeoffs, a concrete Phase 6 spec draft) exists but lives outside this repo — see "Repo status" above; ask Tim for it.
- **Windows** — the `/dev/tty` interactive-prompt approach is Unix-only; `cli/ui/tty_windows.go` currently falls back to deny-by-default and documents the gap rather than faking support.

## CSS

If any UI work needs styling, use TailwindCSS — see `cli/dashboard/build/input.css` (compiled once via the standalone Tailwind CLI, checked into the repo, embedded via `go:embed`; regen instructions are in a comment at the top of that file).

## Commit style

Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`, ...). Explain *why* in the body, not just what — this project's history relies on commit messages carrying the actual rationale for a decision, not just a change summary.
